          <h4>Our Story</h4>
		  <p>We learned about First Tech Challenge at a 4-H Robot C training event in 2013.  Our coach signed up to start a team and received robot kits as a grant from Ole Miss’ Center for Math and Science.  We put together a team and got to work.  In our first season we had a slow start, but finally got a robot built and went to our first qualifying event at Lafayette High in Oxford.  Our robot did okay, but we were excited and had lots of team spirit.  We were chosen by Techno Warriors to go into the Finals and were part of the Winning Alliance.  We also were awarded the Motivate Award, won 2nd Place for the Inspire award, and qualified for the Mississippi FTC State Championship.</p>
		  <p>At State we were a little better prepared. We had a better organized Judges’ Presentation, did lots of Community Outreach, and made improvements to our robot, Geoff, who performed much better.  We were chosen by Blue Crew for the finals and were part of the Winning Alliance.  We also were awarded the Inspire Award for Mississippi, as well as 2nd Place for the Connect Award, and 3rd Place for PTC Design. </p>
		  <p>We qualified for the FTC Southern Super Regionals, which was an awesome experience.  We learned a lot, had a great time, and became even more enthusiastic about First Tech Challenge! Some of our team members even went to volunteer at FTC World!</p>
		  <p>This season we are working super hard and putting in lots of hours on our robot.  We have reached out to professionals in our area to gain assistance and expertise. We did a PTC CREO training seminar as a team. </p>
		  <p>In mid-January we attended the Delta Area qualifier in Greenville, MS where we had an opportunity to compete against 12 other teams. It was and exciting first competition for Geoff and the team.  We learned so much about teamwork and cooperation as we overcame challenges and collaborated with other teams.  We finished with being the 2nd place alliance captain team.  We were nominated for the Motivated Award, the Rockwell Collins Innovate Award and the PTC Design Award.  We won the top award of the day, the Inspire Award.  We have qualified to compete at the Mississippi First Tech Challenge competition in February 2015.</p>
		  <p>We are looking forward to continuing to build our team, improve our robot and to share our excitement with our community. We have about a dozen robot presentations scheduled for the next two months, now that Geoff 2.10 is ready to perform.  It's been a roller coaster ride, but we are loving it and look forward to continuing to compete and spread the First Tech Challenge!</p>
